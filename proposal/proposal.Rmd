## 1. Introduction

This project takes a look into the New York City squirrel population and the factors involved in maintaining and changing numbers. We hope to explore the influences to the NYC squirrel population by borough comparison and by year. Is there a correlation between the squirrel population of a given neighborhood and the environment in which they inhabit? We will take a look into the overall behavior of squirrel sightings by location in comparison with human populations, establishments, and parks. 

* Are squirrels seen more frequently at night or during the day
* What is the most commonly observed squirrel behavior?
* Does squirrel behavior change depending on time of day or time of year?
* What areas of NYC observe the highest number of squirrels?
* What is the squirrel to human ratio of NYC? Of different neighborhoods?

This data comes from the New York City Squirrel Census, which is a raw NY data file. The data was collected by a group of volunteers led by Jamie Allen, a humorist and writer with the hopes of tracking the Eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis) population in New York. When compiling the total census population, they employed a divide and conquer method, dividing Central Park into 350 hectares. Then, the volunteers spread out and counted and observed squirrels once in the morning and once at night.  They then calculated the total number of squirrels by using a formula developed by Vagn Flyger, a squirrel biologist.
