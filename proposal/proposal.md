## 1. Introduction

In this project we aim to gauge the relationship between number of
views, shares, comments, and likes to determine the trending position of
a youtube video. We hope to then explore the trending youtube videos by
country comparison. This dataset includes several months (and counting)
of data on daily trending YouTube videos. Data is included for the US,
GB, DE, CA, FR regions (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, and France,
respectively), and RU, MX, KR, JP and IN regions (Russia, Mexico, South
Korea, Japan and India respectively with up to 200 listed trending
videos per day.

We will analyze which factors impact the overall popularity of a Youtube
video in any given country and compare a cross examination of results.
The response variable for our analysis will be the overall popularity
and ranking of the given YouTube video, with the explanatory variables
being the aforementioned characteristics. We will be analyzing this data
to see if we can predict which videos will perform well in national and
international audiences and the potential implications of this.
