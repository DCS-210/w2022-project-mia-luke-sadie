# Heatmap and time series graphics

The visualization is clear that there are limited patterns to squirrels observed locations, they are failry evently distributed across the entire park. Hectare E14 is the most densley populated squirrel location over the entire time of data series collection, the density displayed in this hectare is around 20 squirrels. The average hectare had less than 5 squirrels spotted in it over the course of data collection. This revels no patterns to where squirrels are seen, but can be indicative of spots with high forestation, high quantities of food, or limited human activity"}

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
