## How do squirrels behave in Central Park? 

Our study attempts to answer a multitude of questions related to the connections between squirrel behaviors and other factors. 
Are squirrel demographic uniform across the entirety of the park? Is there a correlation between the squirrel population of a given hectare of the park and the environment in which they inhabit? Or the noises that they make in relation to the day of week?

# An Introduction to our dataset
##NYC_Squirrels 

This data comes from the New York City Squirrel Census, which is a raw NY data file. The data was collected by a group of volunteers led by Jamie Allen, a humorist and writer, with the hopes of tracking the Eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis) population in New York. 

When compiling the total census population, Allen and his volunteers employed a divide and conquer method, dividing Central Park into 350 hectares. Then, the volunteers spread out and counted and observed squirrels once in the morning and once at night. They then calculated the total number of squirrels by using a formula developed by Vagn Flyger, a squirrel biologist.

## Limitations to the Dataset


- The squirrel census is citizen reported which leaves room for many count errors and identification issues. 

- This dataset is also centered in Central Park New York which only gives us a sample of data from a single area versus the whole of New York. 

- Limited information on who is collecting the data, other than that they are volunteering to count squirrels, so we have to make assumptions about their effectiveness in data collection (i.e. are these kids? retirees? squirrel fanatics?).

---
## Suggested Next Steps

- Conduct a revised NYC Squirrel census that is more comprehensive (takes into account humans, other areas of New York, and other animals in the area). 

- Find a better way to track the squirrels!! GPS tracking or tags could eliminate double sightings and would make identification  easier for the individual reporting a squirrel. This would also be beneficial for a longitudinal study of squirrel behavior and patterns.
